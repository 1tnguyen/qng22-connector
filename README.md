# Introduction 
TODO: Give a short introduction of your project. Let this section explain the objectives or the motivation behind this project. 
Welcome to the Quantum Next Generation 2022 Radar Challenge Beta Phase. I hope you are as excited to tinker with this as I was to build it.
The follow document will contain key information that will ensure the you have a thorough understanding about how the challenge works from a technical perspective and ensure that in the event of issue, the reasoning for it should be easy to understand and work around.
We are all proficient and smart, so let's do our best to aid each other in this process.

This module is a wrapper for the standard Python `request` package, taking standard HTTPS requests like `POST` and `GET` and doing the legwork of making it as accessible as possible.

This system of keeping the simulator online will allow us to have the core operations be hidden and ensure the fairness of this challenge.

# Getting Started
TODO: Guide users through getting your code up and running on their own system. In this section you can talk about:

## Installation Process
This package can be imported into any python script and used with ease. Outlined in this readme will be the functions you need to call to invoke behviours in the simulator, and explanations about their parameters, their returns, and their place in the larger challenge.

To install this package simply place this file with your project and write this into your solution:

    import qe_radar

## Software Dependencies
As mentioned, the `qe_radar.py` is a preconfigured wrapper for the `request` module
